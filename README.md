**Author:** Dhivya Marimuthu  
**Program:** Post Graduate Program in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (Great Learning & UT Austin)

## üìå Project Overview  
AllLife Bank aims to increase its customer base for personal loans. The bank wants to identify liability customers who are most likely to convert into loan customers. This project builds a **Decision Tree model** to predict personal loan purchases and provides business recommendations based on data-driven insights.

## üéØ Objective  
- Predict whether a liability customer will **buy a personal loan**.  
- Identify the **most influential customer attributes** affecting loan purchases.  
- Provide **actionable insights** for targeted marketing strategies.  

## üìä Dataset Description  
The dataset contains **5000** customer records with attributes such as age, income, credit card usage, family size, and education level.  

### **Key Features**
| Feature         | Description |
|---------------|------------|
| Age            | Customer‚Äôs age (years) |
| Experience     | #Years of professional experience |
| Income        | Annual income (in $1000s) |
| Family        | Family size of the customer |
| CCAvg        | Avg. monthly spending on credit cards (in $1000s) |
| Education     | Education Level (1: Undergrad, 2: Graduate, 3: Advanced) |
| Mortgage      | House mortgage value (in $1000s) |
| Personal_Loan | Target Variable (0: No, 1: Yes) |
| Online        | Uses internet banking (0: No, 1: Yes) |
| CreditCard    | Uses other bank credit cards (0: No, 1: Yes) |

## üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Univariate & Bivariate Analysis** conducted using histograms, boxplots, and scatter plots.  
- **Key Insights**:
  - Higher-income customers are **more likely** to take loans.
  - Customers with **higher education levels (Graduate/Advanced)** are more receptive.
  - Holding a **Certificate of Deposit (CD) account** increases loan acceptance.
  - **Family size > 2.5** correlates with higher conversion rates.

## üèóÔ∏è Data Preprocessing  
- **Missing Values**: No missing data found.  
- **Outlier Treatment**: Outliers were analyzed using boxplots.  
- **Feature Engineering**: No redundant features; ZIP Code was removed as it holds no predictive value.  

---

## üíª Technologies Used  
- **Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)**  
- **Machine Learning: Decision Trees with Pruning**  
- **Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn**  

---

## üî• Model Building - Decision Tree  
- A **Decision Tree Classifier** was implemented.  
- **Pre-pruning & Post-pruning** were applied to **reduce overfitting** and improve generalization.  
- Model **evaluation metrics**:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-Score
  - Confusion Matrix

## üìà Model Performance & Evaluation  
| Model Version        | Train Accuracy | Test Accuracy | Overfitting Reduction |
|----------------------|---------------|--------------|-----------------------|
| Initial Decision Tree | **100%**       | **90%**      | High Overfitting ‚ö†Ô∏è |
| Pruned Model (Post)  | **95%**        | **92%**      | Reduced Overfitting ‚úÖ |

- **Feature Importance Analysis** showed that **Income, CCAvg, Education, and CD Account** are the top predictors.
- **Confusion Matrix Analysis** helped reduce **false positives**, improving marketing efficiency.

## üí° Actionable Insights & Business Recommendations  
üîπ **Target High-Income, High-Education Segments**: Customers with **income > 116.50K** and **higher education levels** should be a key focus.  
üîπ **Prioritize CD Account Holders**: CD account holders have a high likelihood of conversion.  
üîπ **Segment Campaigns Based on Credit Card Usage (CCAvg)**: Customers spending **> 2.95K per month** are more likely to take loans.  
üîπ **Focus on Families > 2.5 Members**: They show higher loan acceptance rates.
